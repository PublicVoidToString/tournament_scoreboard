# Tournament Scoreboard

**Tournament Scoreboard** is a web-based application designed to provide a live scoreboards for shooting tournaments.
It was made specificly for one shooting group nearby, which uses a format in which one may have as many attempts as he wishes to buy for each category.
It replaces the previously used Excel solution, that worked fine for smaller tournaments but didn't look good on mobile phones.
